This is where the application actually begins bootstrapping.

In `main.js` files such as Vue itself has been imported, `App.vue` which is the main template serving as the layout file for our application has also been imported as well as other important files such as `store` which is responsible for storing our states and data properties has also been imported. We also have the router file which serves as the parent route for all our routes registered in the various directories across the entire application.
